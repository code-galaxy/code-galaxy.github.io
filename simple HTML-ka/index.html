      <h2>SR-71</h2>
      <p> <i> The Lockheed <span>SR-71</span> "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, strategic reconnaissance
            aircraft
            developed and manufactured by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both
            the United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA.</i></p>

      <p>The <span> SR-71</span> was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during
         the 1960s by
         Lockheed's Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for many
         of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the <span>SR-71 </span> was based on that of the A-12,
         which was one of
         the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of the
         aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment
         for
         the reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo
         camera; the <span>SR-71</span> was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as
         a two-seat
         cockpit. The <span>SR-71</span> designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff
         General Curtis
         LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconnaissance). The
         aircraft
         was introduced to operational service in January 1966.</p>
